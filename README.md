This repository contains the final project for my 10-point Machine Learning computer science class.
In this project, I have developed and trained an agent who can play the game Henefatafl(an ancient Viking game that is also called "Viking Chess").
The agent in question has been trained with reinforcement learning against a random player. The neural network that composes the agent contains both classical deep neural network structures, as well as specific methods based on the basic concepts of reinforcement learning (such as Duelling DQN and Double DQN).
